## About me
I am a Manual QA engineer.

 In my work I use different types of testing: functional (Smoke Testing, Sanity Testing, Regression Testing, Critical path, Exploratory Testing) and non-functional testing (Usability Testing). I spend most of my time working on functional testing on crowdfunding platforms (Test IO, Utest).

My previous experience consists of 2 areas, which help me in the work of testers:
* I know how to build a process and go all the way from requirements gathering to the finished product (as a former Process Development Leader).
* I can use my vision and analytical skills as a UX/UI designer to test software and create real user test cases.

## Skills
You can find examples of the described skills in the [Examples of my work](#examples-of-my-work) section.

__Test analysis & design__
 * I can apply Equivalent Class Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, and Pairwise Testing to create inputs for tests.
 * I have experience with functional (Smoke Testing, Sanity Testing, Regression Testing, Critical path, Exploratory Testing) and non-functional testing (Usability Testing).
 * Work based on black/grey box methodology.

__Test documentation__
 * I have the skills to create test cases and checklists and how and in what situations to use them productively.
 * I can write a comprehensive error report so that every person's way is how it can be reproduced.

__Manual testing__
  * I have practical experience testing applications on crowdfunding platforms (Test IO, Utest) and can perform manual functional and usability testing of web applications.
  * Understanding of software testing methodologies for Web applications

# Examples of my work

Here are several examples of frontend test cases designed using different testing design techniques while testing the sample [personal diet site](https://www.eatthismuch.com/).

## Test data & Test cases

The test data to be used in the test cases were prepared by me using 3 test design techniques (Equivalent Class Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Pairwise Testing).

You can check the documentation on [this repository](https://github.com/Dinara2010/Portfolio-QA/tree/main/TestCase%26TestData).

## Bug reports in Jira

Several bugs were found in the random [online store](https://www.zalando.co.uk/) and were on the production version of the website. You can check the bug reports on [this repository](https://github.com/Dinara2010/Portfolio-QA/tree/main/Bug-reports).

## MySQL Workbench
I have created several queries in MySQL Workbench.Check out the queries and the database in [this repository](https://github.com/Dinara2010/Portfolio-QA/tree/main/SQL) or on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gqaJu3gAngJL6aluU_rAJP4enhc2sHEr?usp=sharing)
